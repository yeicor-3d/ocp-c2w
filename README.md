# OCP C2W

This project can build [Build123d](https://github.com/gumyr/build123d)-based CAD
models (which relies on [OCP](https://github.com/CadQuery/OCP)) **completely inside the web browser**, thanks to [container2wasm](https://github.com/ktock/container2wasm).

- You can [run the demo script on github pages](https://yeicor-3d.github.io/ocp-c2w/). It works, but it is **extremely slow**...
- You can also get an **interactive console** and basic networking by [clicking this link](https://yeicor-3d.github.io/ocp-c2w/?args=bash&net=browser).
