# OCP C2W

Create [build123d](https://github.com/gumyr/build123d)/[OCP](https://github.com/CadQuery/OCP) CAD
models **completely inside the web browser**, thanks to [container2wasm](https://github.com/ktock/container2wasm).

- You can [run the demo script on github pages](https://yeicor-3d.github.io/ocp-c2w/). It works, but it is **extremely slow** (~33min)...
- You can also get an **interactive console** and basic networking by [clicking this link](https://yeicor-3d.github.io/ocp-c2w/?args=tar%20-C%20%2F%20-xzvf%20libs.tar.gz%20%26%26%20rm%20libs.tar.gz%20%26%26%20bash&net=browser).
